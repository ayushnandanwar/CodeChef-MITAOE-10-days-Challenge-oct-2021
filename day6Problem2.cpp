/*
    Day 6 - Question 2 : 
	You are given two strings a and b. You are going to print the string a character 
    by character, from the first character to the last one.

	When printing a character, instead of pressing the button corresponding to it,
     you can press the "Backspace" button. It deletes the last character you have 
     printed among those that aren't deleted yet (or does nothing if there are no 
     characters in the current string). For example, if string a is "abcbd" and you 
     press Backspace instead of typing the first and the fourth characters, you will 
     get the string "bd" (the first press of Backspace deletes no character, and the s
     econd press deletes the character 'c'). Another example, if string a is "abcaa" and 
     you press Backspace instead of the last two letters, then the resulting text is "a".

	Your task is to determine whether you can obtain the string b, if you print the s
    tring a and press "Backspace" instead of printing several (maybe zero) characters of a.
	
    Example

    Input:
        4
        ababa
        ba
        ababa
        bb
        aaa
        aaaa
        aababa
        ababa

    Output:
        YES
        NO
        NO
        YES
